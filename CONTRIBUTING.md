## Setting up a development environment

<!-- First, you need to fork the project. Then setup your environment:

```bash
# create a new conda environment
conda create -n xeus-clickhouse -c conda-forge -c defaults xtl nlohmann_json cppzmq xeus
conda activate xeus-clickhouse

# download xeus-clickhouse from your GitHub fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/xeus-clickhouse.git
```

You may also want to install a C++17 or later version compiler, and cmake from conda if they are not available on your system.
